# No longer maintained!

## Thanks for checking out my repository! However, it hasn't been updated for a long time and there is a much better (official!) library for interacting with APNS on Vapor. 
## Check it out here: https://github.com/vapor/apns. It is based on the awesome library of kylebrowning, [APNSwift](https://github.com/kylebrowning/APNSwift).

VaporAPNS is a simple, yet elegant, Swift library that allows you to send Apple Push Notifications using HTTP/2 protocol in Linux & macOS. It has support for the brand-new [Token Based Authentication](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/724/) but if you need it, the traditional certificate authentication method is ready for you to use as well. Choose whatever you like!
